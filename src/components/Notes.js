      <h2>Director's Notes</h2>
      <p>
        It's easy to live a life without curiosity. To spend years, never
        feeling the need to search for something or to never ponder what if? As
        one ages, life unfortunately becomes less intriguing and less worthy of
        investigation. In time, we become far too comfortable, our sense of
        wonder tends to wane, and sometimes we even become afraid of curiosity.
        But a lass our dear audience, not our heroine, Constance Ledbelly.
        Despite what her name ironically implies, her courage to take this
        journey and to ask new questions about stories so old they're ubiquitous
        within Western culture, is what makes her story worthy to tell. It's
        also why I love this play and why I chose it as our Spring production.

        While working on this project, I couldn't help but think about how
        Contance and my students share the same stars; they both have something
        in common. The mousy academic and my madcap cast and crew are both on
        chaotic, embarrassing, and yes, dramatic quests of self-discovery. I
        doubt very much my students will ever meet a joke telling ghost (at
        least I hope not) nor will they ever find themselves in the middle of an
        Elizabethan tragedy (I definitely hope not), but they will experience
        the same sense of doubt, heart break, and wonder that Constance does.
        Luckily, she finds her way and like any discovery worthy of a voyage,
        her philosopher's stone shows her just how special she really is. And
        while my students may not have the eyes to see it, soon, their
        philosopher's stone will turn base metal into precious gold.

        I am incredibly proud of this committed and talented group of students.
        Their willingness to take on this sophisticated and elaborate play is
        inspiring. By breathing life into Malvern's stage, you all continue to
        strengthen a sacred tradition--live theatre. You've made The Bard, both
        beardless and bearded, extremely proud!
